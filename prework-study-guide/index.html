          <li>The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device). The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.</li>
          <li>UTF-8 is a character encoding standard used for electronic communication. Defined by the Unicode Standard, the name is derived from Unicode Transformation Format - 8-bit.Almost every webpage is stored in UTF-8.</li>

          <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage.</li>
          <li>The img element can contain various attributes such as src is the most important attribute because it defines the location of an image.</li>

          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The script element embeds client side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li>In semantic HTML elements the name describes it's content and role, such as body element. Use these when possible as they make HTML easier to read.</li>
          <li>Examples of non semantic elements include div which creates a division in the page or span to create an inline division.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is used to style an element directly in the HTML file. Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. Useful for quick permanent changes.</li>
          <li>An example of Inline CSS would be using the style attribute to change the color of a single h1 heading.</li>
          <li>You can embed an entire stylesheet directly into an HTML file using a style element in the head element. This internal stlye sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. This rule would onlt apply to that page.</li>
          <li>External CSS style sheets are the most common way to style a webpage. It allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file making design changes easier.</li>
          <li>When using a external style sheet we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head.</li>
          <li>Separation of concerns is a term referring to seperating code into different files based on use. Based on the idea that each section of code should have it's own responsibility.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two components the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. color: blue; the property is color and the value is blue.</li>
          <li>The margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. The margin is not visible on the page, it only adds a buffer.</li>
          <li>The padding property adds space around the content inside an element. When you increase the padding you make the entire element bigger. The padding is transparent but is located inside the element.</li>
          <li>The * selector applies a rule to all elements visible on the page.</li>
        </ul>

          <li>git checkout main switches to the main branch.</li>
          <li>git add -A The add command adds modifications in the current working branch to the staging area. The -A flag indicates that we want to add all changes.</li>
          <li>git commit -m "descriptive message" commit your staged content as a new commit snapshot.</li>
          <li>git pull fetch and merge any commits from the tracking remote branch. Such as the command git pull origin main would receive a branch's modifications into the local envirnment. The origin keyword indicates the source of the pull such as the GitHub repo.</li>
          <li>git push would send the commits to the GitHub repo.</li>

          <li>Conditional statements and loops can be used to control in which code is executed. Or executed at all.</li>
          <li>Falsy if it is one of the following values 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN or a Boolean data type with the value of false.</li>
          <li>All other values, including a Boolean with the value if true, are considered truthy.</li>

          <li>The "===" checks to see if two values are equal.</li>
          <li>Arrays store multiple data types in one variable.</li>

          <li>const assigns a variable that cannot be changed.</li>
          <li>The let keyword followed by a unique varible name and the assignment operator = to assign a value to a varible. let allows us to reassign a varible over time.</li>
