# Study Guide for EdX Coding Bootcamp Students

## Description

- The major motivating factors behind this project was to create a webpage to serve as a comprehensive study guide for myself and other students. While also providing a hands on experiance in using the basics of HTML, CSS, Javascript and Git to give myself a foundation in these tools.   
- With this project going live, students as well as myself will have a easy to use and accessible webpage showcasing notes that are valuable for success within the bootcamp. 
- The work that went into this project which was primarily focused on the basics of web development and Git gaining knowledge in these areas is very important for my future success. Additional lessons this project taught me were in time managment and the importance of building a good routine. As well as the ability and discipline to focus in order to finish the project.
